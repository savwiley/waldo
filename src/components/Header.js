/**
 * I need this to stick to the top of the page and not be very tall.
 * 
 * I'm thinking chars to find on left side, timer on right side (powered by firebase), and MAYBE the app's title in the middle if there's room on mobile.
 * 
 * Maybe connect the 'add high score' logic in here.
 * 
 * If there are different difficulties, they should be noted in here so that the images of chars can change.
